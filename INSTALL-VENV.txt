Notes taken during my quest to install ViTables in a virtual environment.

* there is no stable release on PyPI, so "pip install vitables" fails:
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement vitables
  (from versions: 2.2a1)

* the only version that is on PyPI is an alpha release, so it should be
  installed with "pip install --pre vitables", but this fails with:
  IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '[...]\vitables\\VERSION'

* installing 2.0 from source
    pip install https://vitables.googlecode.com/files/ViTables-2.0.tar.gz
  or
    get source and "python setup.py install"
  fails with latest version of PyQT because of a bad version check (4.4 > 4.10)

* installing using one of Gohlke's binary installers does not work by default
  (in a virtual environment), but can be done via:
    easy_install INSTALLER.EXE
  or
    pip install wheel
    wheel convert INSTALLER.EXE
    pip install INSTALLER.WHL

* installing 2.1 from source
    pip install https://vitables.googlecode.com/files/ViTables-2.1.tar.gz
  or
    git co v2.1
    python setup.py install
  works but needs sphinx installed due to a small glitch in the setup.py
  (otherwise we get a "NameError: name 'BuildDoc' is not defined" exception)

* installing git master as of 18/09/2014
    pip install git+https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables@master
  or
    git clone https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables
    python setup.py install
  works with a few glitches:
  - tree of db sorting plugin does not show up (and causes errors in the log)
  - activating the columnar_org plugin makes vitables fail to start and we have
    to delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ViTables\2.1\Plugins in the registry to
    have it work again!
  this is only a problem of bad setup.py, I think

* installing git develop as of 18/09/2014
    pip install git+https://github.com/uvemas/ViTables@develop
  fails. It installs but fails at runtime because all .ui files are missing
